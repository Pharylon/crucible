<h3>History</h3>

<p>
  Legends tell of ancient empires ruled by giants, dragons, and the fey. Only fragments from those times exist today,
  leaving scholars the task of separating history from legend.
</p>
<p>
  What is known for sure is that nearly a thousand years ago, the human kingdom of Zelath rose up in the Northeast,
  expanding and bringing others under it’s sway so that even the dwarves and elves swore fealty to it. It’s borders
  ever-expanding, it eventually came into contact with the Ixalga, a nation of goblinoids
  expanding from the distant South. The two came into conflict, but the Ixalga had the superior army. Early
  campaigns did not go well for Zelath, and in desperation the human kings made a pact with Asmodeus himself. With
  his demonic magic, they turned the tide. The armies of Zelath and it’s allies fought back the Ixalga and
  reclaimed much of their lost land. The war stretched out over generations, with only small lapses in the fighting, and
  became known as the Forever War. By the end, both countries had exhausted their wealth. They were two lumbering
  giants that no longer had the resources to fight, but were unable to bring themselves to living in peace.
</p>
<p>
  It was not the war that ultimately ruined the empires, however. Four hundred years ago in the city of Esa, a new
  religion began to take hold. The followers of the Worldsmith taught that there was only one true God, and that
  trials of the world were a test put before us. Furthermore, they believed that the Worldsmith was angry for
  allowing the demonic forces of the Zelath to control the land. The Zelathi authorities engaged in a campaign
  of brutal suppression against them, culminating in the hanging of several prominent members on a cold winter day.
</p>
<p>
  At first this seemed to quell the religious uprising, at least publicly, but the next as the months passed,
  the people of the continent noticed something: the weather was not getting warmer. For the next seven years,
  Crucible experienced unusually frigid winters and extremely cool summers with little rain. Crops failed across the
  continent, and civil order broke down both in Zelath and Ixalga.
</p>
<p>
  Little is known of what happened in the far away land of Ixalga, but in Zelath, the nobility had long begun to show
  outward signs of their pact
  with the demons, their skin having turned red and horns sprouting from their heads, becoming the first tieflings. It
  did not take much to rile the peasantry against such obviously demonic leaders when the weather itself seemed to be
  turning against them. The rebellion fueled by the Wordsmith followers grew until the Zelath empire, already weak from
  it's never-ending war with Ixalga, collapsed.
</p>
<p>
  Out of the ashes of Zelath, however, a new empire rose. The Esathian Empire saw it's job to spread the world of the
  Worldsmith across Crucible. Whatever people they conquered, they took pains to assimilate them into the empire.
  Early expansion went well. Often, their armies moved into areas that were once part of the Zealthi nation, areas now
  poor and isolated. And while the Zealthians had treated non-humans as second-class citizens, the Esatheans
  saw all races as able to worship the Worldsmith.
</p>
<p>
  But four centures after it's founding, Esa fell too. Unlike the previous empires, no earth-shaking event heralded it’s
  fall – it was a slow
  process. The courts of Esa slowly became a viper’s nest of intrigue and and politics that paralyzed the nobility.
  Slowly, local city-states emerged as the true centers of power, paying fealty to Esa at first but eventually only
  lip-service. Esa became irrelevant over the course of a century.
</p>
<p>With power devolved to city-states, local barons and lords bickered and fought over resources. The games of intrigue
  played in Esa not only failed to unify the city-states again, but actively prevented such reunification, as each
  lord angled to take the power all for their own. Raids from the barbarian peoples, such as orcs and goblins had always
  been a problem, but without a unified national response they became more common. </p>
<p>
  Fifteen years ago, the capitol of the Esathian empire was sacked. An orcish chieftain united the clans of orcs living
  on the nearby steppes and burned a swath of destruction into the heart of the Empire. While he died in battle,
  the damage was done. The center of the empire had suddenly disintegrated.
</p>
<p>
  That brings us to the present day. The orcs haven't left. When the orcish army disbanded, many went back to the
  steppes,
  but many more disappeared into the woodlands, hills, and mountains throughout the former Esathian Empire. Each day,
  their raids grow more bold. Each day, another town falls, another farming village is burned. Food is becoming scarce
  in the cities.
</p>
<p>
  And yet this has not galvanized the former Esathian cities to unify against a common threat. Instead, the nobles
  bicker and argue about who the "true" heir to the Empire should be. They are building up their own armies, but
  will they be used against the orcs or each other? The world is a powder-keg. Will it explode?
