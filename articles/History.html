<h3>History</h3>

<p>
  Legends tell of ancient empires ruled by giants, dragons, and the fey. Only fragments from those times exist today,
  leaving scholars the task of separating history from legend.

  What is known for sure is that nearly a thousand years ago, the human kingdom of Bael Turath rose up in the Northeast,
  expanding and bringing others under it’s sway so that even the dwarves and elves swore fealty to it. It’s borders
  ever-expanding, it eventually came into contact with the Arkhosian Empire, ruled by the Dragonborn and itself
  expanding from the distant South. The two came into conflict, but the Arkhosians had the superior army. Early
  campaigns did not go well for Bael Turath, and in desperation the human kings made a pact with Asmodeus himself. With
  his demonic magic, they turned the tide. The armies of Bael Turath and it’s allies fought back the Arkhosians and
  reclaimed much of their lost land. The war stretched out over generations, with only small lapses in the fighting, and
  became known as the Forever War.|

  By the end, both countries had exhausted their wealth. They were two lumbering giants that no longer had the resources
  to fight, but were unable to bring themselves to living in peace. But it was not their endless war that ultimately
  ruined them. The Seven Year Winter marked the end of both empires. For seven years, Crucible experienced unusually
  frigid winters and extremely cool summers with little rain. Crops failed across the continent, and civil order broke
  down. Rioting engulfed both empires. In Bael Turath, the nobility had long begun to show outward signs of their pact
  with the demons, their skin having turned red and horns sprouting from their heads, becoming the first tieflings. It
  did not take much to rile the peasantry against such obviously demonic leaders.

<p>
  It was during this tumultuous time that the religion of the Magisterium took hold in Nerath, supplementing the Old
  Ways. It taught that there was only one true God, and that he was angry at the civilized races for allowing monstrous
  creatures to rule. The religion quickly spread and it’s followers sacked the capital of Bael Turath within a few short
  years of their founder’s martyring.

<p>
  This new religion, the Magisterium, would become the cornerstone of the next empire to rise. The looting of Bael
  Turath brought much wealth to city of the church’s founding, Nerath, and coupled with the spread of their religion it
  was soon the dominant city in the region, eventually forging a nation and then a new empire. Though it never gained
  the fealty of the nonhuman races or quite the reach that Bael Turath had, over the centuries that followed, Nerath was
  nevertheless the de facto power of Crucible for the next four centuries.

<p>
  Nerath fell too, however. Unlike the empires previous, no earth-shaking event heralded it’s fall – it was a slow
  process. The courts of Nerath slowly became a viper’s nest of intrigue and and politics that paralyzed the nobility.
  Slowly, local city-states emerged as the true centers of power, paying fealty to Nerath at first but eventually only
  lip-service. Nerath became irrelevant over the course of a century.

</p>
<p>With power devolved to city-states, local barons and lords bickered and fought over resources. The games of intrigue
  played in Nerath not only failed to unify the city-states again, but actively prevented such reunification, as each
  lord angled to take the power all for their own. Raids from the barbarian peoples, such as orcs and goblins had always
  been a problem, but without a unified national response they became more common. With more villages being raided, the
  local economies suffered, and less taxes went to the nobility, meaning less forces could be spared to fight off the
  humanoids. This cycle of destruction has lasted for a century, and now the civilized races stand on the precipice of
  destruction.</p>
