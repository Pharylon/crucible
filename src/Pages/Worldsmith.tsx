      <h1>The Church of the Worldsmith</h1>

      <p>
        The Church of the Worldsmith is the monotheistic religion of most Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, and Halflings.

</p>
      <h2>Feel</h2>

      <p>
        The Church is meant to have a very “middle ages church” feel. Great cathedrals and churches have been erected by the Worldsmith, and city-dwelling races are either followers or keep their divergent beliefs quiet. The church elders are almost never the local lord or mayor, but is likewise almost always a powerful and respected figure in the city.

</p>
      <p>
        It is overall a force of good in the world, and teaches compassion and mercy while extolling the virtue of hard work and overcoming adversity. On paper, the church is extremely egalitarian. A noble and a peasant have the same chance of becoming a abbot or bishop. In practice, nobility that joins the church does have a leg-up, but even they do not truly get a free pass. Of all the faiths in Crucible, the Church is the only one that is really shared among the races.

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        The Church traces it’s roots to the dwarvish kingdom of Araz-khact. The prophet Morguhn did not receive divine knowledge directly, but through dwarven pragmatism and intelligence came to believe in a single Creator, one who was the ultimate craftsman, who had made the world for his own inscrutable purposes. The world was too consistent, he argued, to have been created collaboratively by this hodge-podge of deities worshiped by everyone else. He called this deity the Worldsmith, and over several centuries it spread throughout the Dwarven kingdom.

</p>
      <p>
        Not long before the Seven Year Winter (see <Link to="/history">History</Link>), a silversmith named Justinia was apprenticing among the dwarves, and was struck by the sensibility of it. She took the religion farther, though, and believed that the Worldsmith had made all of creation as a kind of crucible to test his followers. When she returned to her home city of Esa in the second year of the Seven Year Winter, she found a people looking for answers. The priests’ usual prayers and exhortations did nothing to warm the world again, and the people despaired that their gods had forsaken them. Justinia had the answer. There is but one God, and he was angry. The Worldsmith, the one true Divinity, had created this world as a crucible for his people, to forge them through trials and tribulations into better people. Yet his creations had allowed themselves to be corrupted, to be ruled over by fell humanoids. The Worldsmith was angry.

</p>
      <p>
        Justinia’s beliefs spread, they were new and strange and something to grab hold of in those uncertain times. More pragmatically, they seemed to offer a solution to the crisis. In the sixth year of her teaching, what was left of Zelath’s army came to Esa to suppress her followers, as they didn’t want the anti-tiefling rhetoric to spread any further. Justinia was arrested and publicly hung, drawn, and quartered – the punishment for high treason. It is said that throughout the entire process, she prayed to the Worldsmith not to hold the actions of the guards against humanity, but against their tiefling masters.

</p>
      <p>
        When her quartered body was put on display throughout the city, they became rallying cries for her followers. Sentiment with the tieflings was already at a low boil, and the public execution of Justinia became a flash point – the city became a mob. It is said that none from Zelathh’s army left Esa alive. This only increased Justinia’s stock in the eyes of the city, and arming themselves with the weapons of the fallen army, Justinia’s followers marched to the capital of Zelath and burned it to the ground. The next winter was mild, and the next summer was warm and wet again. It was seen as a sign from the divine, and belief in the Worldsmith was cemented in the hearts of Her followers.

</p>
      <p>
        Justinia’s followers continued her work in Esa, founding the Synod, the center for Justinian religious teaching. The Synod became a force to be reckoned with, and virtually controlled the local nobility. The looting of Zealth brought much wealth to Esa and soon it was the dominant city in the region, eventually forging a nation and then a new empire. Though it never gained quite the reach as Zelath had, over the centuries that followed, Esa was nevertheless the de facto power of Crucible for the next four centuries.

</p>
      <p>
        Through missionaries, the Church exported their faith to the other races as well, converting dwarves and halflings that lived in the human cities. The dwarves were already receptive, having originated the belief in the Worldsmith and finding little to argue with regarding to miracle of the end of the Seven Year Winter coinciding with the destruction of Zelath. While some have accepted the authority of the Synod in Esa, most dwarven worship remains independent. This causes some friction, but overall their religions are more similar than not, and there has never been any real conflict between the two.

</p>
      <p>
        The Church's holy symbol is a silver noose, for the hanging of Justinia. Dwarven worshipers of the Worldsmith more commonly use the symbol of a hammer poised over a sphere, representing the planet. He is also sometimes called the Maker, the Creator, the Divinity and the God. Officially, the Worldsmith is considered genderless. It is considered "best practice" to avoid pronouns when speaking of the Worldsmith, but when necessary, most humans use feminine pronouns (She/Her) while dwarves tend to use masculine ones (Him/His). Some scholars, however, use gender-neutral pronouns (Them/They). None of these is considered wrong. The Worldsmith's pronouns should always be written capitalized.

</p>
      <h2>Teachings</h2>

      <p>
        While the Church has a Christian-church feel, it's faith is not anything like real-world Christianity. In particular, they don't have any real concept of "sin," except that which would cause the world or society as a whole to fail the Worldsmith's tests.

</p>
      <p>
        What the Church does teach is that the world is designed to be a test, and overcoming the difficulties that the world presents shows the Worldsmith our worthiness. They believe that the Divinity only rarely intervenes directly in the day-to-day affairs of the Crucible, and the Synod does not recognize any miracles after the Seven Year Winter, over four centuries ago. They do believe that the Worldsmith is overall a being of good, but also a strict teacher with sometimes harsh lessons.

</p>
      <p>
        The Worldsmith has not left the world completely without aid, though. The Maker also created the Exemplars, powerful entities that oversee the world for Her. In time past, people took these for gods, but the Synod teaches that they are something like a cross between angels and saints – beings created by the Worldsmith, with specific duties to oversee for Her. Most of the pious simply pray to the Divinity and often do not even know the names of the various Exemplars, but it is not uncommon for someone to have a personal favorite patron. This is especially true for clerics and paladins, who's domains and oaths are often informed by a patron Exemplar.

</p>
      <p>
        However, followers are instructed not to pray directly to the patrons. Even a short thanks to Avandra for luck is dangerously close to crossing the line. Praying directly to the patrons smacks of the <Link to="/oldWays">Old Ways</Link>.

</p>

      <h2>Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The Synod had much the same structure as the Catholic church, with local abbots and priests that oversee cities, and bishops that oversee regions. These all report to cardinals. There is no central authority figure analogous to the Pope, however. Instead, the Curia Magisterium, or just “The Curia” is a council of Cardinals that guide the church.

</p>
      <p>
        Many of the Cardinals were slain during the sacking of Esa. A few remain in the city attempting to rebuild the center of the church, and the informal connections between priests and bishops are rare open lines of communication in the now-fractured countryside.
