# Arandor

The Arandor region of Crucible has been settled for centuries. A thousand years ago, it was the home to numerous tribes of humans that rarely banded together into any cohesive government. With the rise of Zelath, Arandor was organized into a cohesive principality under the oversight of the empire, with governors appointed by the tiefling nobility.

With the fall of Zelath, the governorship became more or less inherited. It should be noted, however, that a little rebellion and overthrowing of the nobility was more or less accepted by the populace if the government was doing poorly. Arandor has no myth of “divine right of kings.”

Once Esa rose to power, the religion of the <a href="./woldsmith">Worldsmith</a> swept in with most of the populace quickly converting in the wake of the Seven Year Winter. Soon the local nobility found itself once again bowing to another nation as the new church exerted it’s influence.

With the disintegration of the Esathian Empire, the Duke of Arandor is now the local king in all but name. The largest city in the region is <a href="./blackport">Blackport</a>.

# Development

If this seems sparse, it is. I don't have a ton of stuff developed for the Arandor region yet. The intention is for this area to be about the size of France or the UK, and have a few major places of interest and a couple big cities. I'm going to start detailing one a little bit (Blackport). The rest is open for development. 

I do have the idea that Arandor is just outside of the core of the Empire. Esa isn't *too* far away.
