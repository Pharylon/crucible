# History

Legends tell of ancient empires ruled by giants, dragons, and the fey. Only fragments from those times exist today, leaving scholars the task of separating history from legend.

What is known for sure is that nearly a thousand years ago, the human kingdom of Zelath rose up in the Northeast, expanding and bringing others under it’s sway so that even the dwarves and elves swore fealty to it. It’s borders ever-expanding, it eventually came into contact with the Ixalga, a nation of goblinoids expanding from the distant South. The two came into conflict, but the Ixalga had the superior army. Early campaigns did not go well for Zelath, and in desperation the human kings made a pact with Asmodeus himself. With his demonic magic, they turned the tide. The armies of Zelath and it’s allies fought back the Ixalga and reclaimed much of their lost land. The war stretched out over generations, with only small lapses in the fighting, and became known as the Forever War. 

By the end, both countries had exhausted their wealth. They were two lumbering giants that no longer had the resources to fight, but were unable to bring themselves to living in peace. But it was not their endless war that ultimately ruined them. The Seven Year Winter marked the end of both empires. For seven years, Crucible experienced unusually frigid winters and extremely cool summers with little rain. Crops failed across the continent, and civil order broke down. Rioting engulfed both empires. In Zelath, the nobility had long begun to show outward signs of their pact with the demons, their skin having turned red and horns sprouting from their heads, becoming the first tieflings. It did not take much to rile the peasantry against such obviously demonic leaders.

It was during this tumultuous time that the new religion of the <a href="./woldSmith">Worldsmith</a> took hold in Nerath, supplementing the <a href="./oldWays">Old Ways</a>. It taught that there was only one true God, and that he was angry at the civilized races for allowing monstrous creatures to rule. The religion quickly spread and it’s followers sacked the capital of Zelath within a few short years of their founder’s martyring.

Out of the ashes of Zelath, however, a new empire rose. The Esathian Empire saw it's job to spread the world of the <a href="./woldSmith">Worldsmith</a> across Crucible. Whatever people they conquered, they took pains to assimilate them into the empire. Early expansion was swift and relatively painless. Often, their armies moved into areas that were once part of the Zealthi nation, areas now poor and isolated. And while the Zealthians had treated non-humans as second-class citizens, the Esatheans saw all races as able to worship the <a href="./woldSmith">Worldsmith</a>.

But four centuries after it's founding, Esa fell too. Unlike the previous empires, no earth-shaking event heralded it’s fall – it was a slow process. The courts of Esa slowly became a viper’s nest of intrigue and and politics that paralyzed the nobility. Slowly, local city-states emerged as the true centers of power, paying fealty to Esa at first but eventually only lip-service. Esa became irrelevant over the course of a century.

With power devolved to city-states, local barons and lords bickered and fought over resources. The games of intrigue played in Esa not only failed to unify the city-states again, but actively prevented such reunification, as each lord angled to take the power all for their own. Raids from the barbarian peoples, such as orcs and goblins had always been a problem, but without a unified national response they became more common.

Fifteen years ago, the capitol of the Esathian empire was sacked. An orcish chieftain united the clans of orcs living on the nearby steppes and burned a swath of destruction into the heart of the Empire. While he died in battle, the damage was done. The center of the empire had suddenly disintegrated.

That brings us to the present day. The orcs haven't left. When the orcish army disbanded, many went back to the steppes, but many more disappeared into the woodlands, hills, and mountains throughout the former Esathian Empire. Each day, their raids grow more bold. Each day, another town falls, another farming village is burned. Food is becoming scarce in the cities.

And yet this has not galvanized the former Esathian cities to unify against a common threat. Instead, the nobles bicker and argue about who the "true" heir to the Empire should be. They are building up their own armies, but will they be used against the orcs or each other? The world is a powder-keg. Will it explode?
