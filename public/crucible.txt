# Crucible 

## Geography

The world of Crucible itself is approximately the same size as Earth, but is possessed of greater temperature extremes. The continent that bares the same name as the world, Crucible, exists in the southern hemisphere, with icy glaciers in the south and a tropical climate in the north that gives way to a never-ending desert that disappears into the unknown north. The few ships that have ventured far North have reported land so hot that water boils on the rocks, and the heat itself has turned even the most well-rationed ships around as the sailors bake in the hulls.

Most areas are populated primarily by humanity, though forests are of course home to the elves, and it seems nearly every mountain has been hollowed out by the dwarves. Human society throughout Crucible is very similar to Europe in the 1700s. However, no countries truly exist, with the largest power being that of the city-state. Powerful cities are able to exert control as far as their militia takes itâ€™s swords, usually no more than a few days travel. These cities become ringed by hamlets that provide for grain and produce to the local baron. A city-stateâ€™s power can wax or wane dramatically depending on the ability of the local baron.

## Development

I may add a second continent, in which case I'd probably want to change the name of the primary continent too. ðŸ˜€

Some areas I know exist but don't have much written on them:

Prima Archborea: The first forest, and a big Elven kingdom. A bunch of Forest Gnomes there too. Very feywild-ish.

The Balelands: A cursed land, originally the center of Zelath. Think werewolves and vampires there. 

Orcish Steppes: A flat grassland home to some human barbarian tribes, but mostly orcs. This is where the army came from that sacked Esa

Esa: The capitol of the old empire, got burned by orcs. In the rebuilding phase currently, a shadow of its former self.

Khaz: A dwarven kingdom. I'm kind of leaning toward making the dwarves communist and them having Russian accents :D 


## Feel

I'm going for a pre-industrial vibe. Steam Engines exist, but they're mostly bespoke unreliable things. NPCs that can cast magic are fairly common at low levels, but drop off at high levels. I'm not sure if there is a single 20th level caster in the whole world.
